# Security
You are in charge of security at a casino, and there is a thief who is trying to steal the casino's money!  Look over the security diagrams to make sure that you always have a guard between the thief and the money!
There is one money location, one thief, and any number of guards on each floor of the casino.
Evaluate a given floor of the casino to determine if there is a guard between the money and the thief, if there is not, you will sound an alarm.
